### Recommendation 1 (code lines: [63](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs400/202501/students/SCAMEHORN/P209.RoleCode/-/blob/main/Backend.java#L63)):  
While the code checks for the digraph line for the correct file, it never actually calls nextLine() on it,  
so this line of the file makes the delimiter not work, and the lq[1] throw an indexing exception, so I  
would just recommend calling s.nextLine() once before starting taking in input.  
  
### Recommendation 2 (code lines: [126](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs400/202501/students/SCAMEHORN/P209.RoleCode/-/blob/main/Backend.java#L126)):  
When path size is 1, an empty list is returned, but this scenario would be where the start and end location  
is the same, so I believe that a list with just 0.0 should be returned.

The delimiter used doesn't actually properly separate the values in the file, I would recommend changing it  
so that it separates the values by "->" and "[seconds=", to extract the values from the file.

In the method loadGraphData, the code  accesses index 1 of the lq array This causes an  
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because the first line is "digraph campus {." which does not contain the  
regex charecter and therefore does not get split. Category: Implements Specification

The for loop starts at index nodes.size() - 1 and stops at i > 0, which skips index 0. Category: Code

The check of path.size() being 0 or 1 results in the same output and thus could be condensed into one if  
statement instead of 2. Category: Organization & Readability

You got an index out of bounds error here but I think your loop here was unnecessary and it cost you so I  
would suggest to remove it.  
  
### Recommendation 2 (code lines: [160-166](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs400/202501/students/SCAMEHORN/P209.RoleCode/-/blob/main/Backend.java#L160-166)):  
I would make sure that you actually have the first node show up on all cases for the for loop in your  
getReachableFromWithin() method and so I would just check to see if the final node in the graph has a  
travel time of greater than or less to the time given if it greater than or equal to keep the same loop  
that you currently have otherwise add the first node separately and then go through the loop.

You in-line commenting is very inconsistent because sometimes you have in-line comments and sometimes you  
don't and the lines above are the ones where you don't so I would suggest that you go through your code and  
write the in-line comments accordingly.
