AVL Trees: 
Self balancing bst (alternative to rbt)
Uses rotations to maintain balane 
Goal: keep the height of the tree with n nodes growing in O(log(N))

AVL Tree insertion:
1. Insert a new value using regular BST insertion algo 
2. Check if tree is out of balance, and rebalance if it is. 

Balance Factor: (bf) = (height_left_subtree) - (height_right_subtree)
  A node is balanced if abs(bf) < 2 ~= bf < -2 or bf > 2
  Sign tells us the direction of inbalance
  A tree is balanced if and only if every node in the tree is balanced. 

Re-Balancing, given the following tree
(10),-2
    \
   (20),-1
      \
      (30),0

bf of node (10) is -2, which means it needs to be rebalanced.
